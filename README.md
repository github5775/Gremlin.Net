# Gremlin.Net
This is an adapted version of the Gremlin.Net project that is part of Apache/TinkerPop.  I have modified it to handle the case where the server has dropped the connection without notifying the client.  In that case, the call to the server will hang until it times out, sometimes up to 60 seconds!  Essentially, this modification forces the client to check the connection status before submitting the request.  In the case where the status of the connection is not open, the modification will refresh the connection, then send the request.  This allows the code that calls this layer to not require any knowledge of this process.
